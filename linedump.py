# linedump.py

# Linedump is a format for visualising monitoring information as a line of chars.
# It is designed to be easy to parse for both humans and machines.
# It can be used for simple shell programs, interactive CLI applications or in logs.

# Default linedump format:
#
# - A linedump is a string with a predetermined number of chars
# - New linedumps are made up of placeholder chars for "undefined"
# - Each char represents a state
# - Chars are added one by one to a given position
# - If all chars are added the linedump is printed to standard output
# - Each char has a corresponding key
# - Key can be invoked to get details about the state described by char
# - Keys are ASCII printable characters, 33 to 126 (93 total)

# Default character format:
#
# _ => Undefined: Placeholder
# . => Good: Host is up to date
# ! => Bad: Host is outdated
# ? => Unknown: Host cannot be analysed
# Â¿ => Unreachable: Host cannot be reached
